## ðŸ“Œ Project  2 - Market Basket Analysis in Python using Apriori Algorithm

This project focuses on performing market basket analysis on the Grocery dataset to discover relationships between products. I used popular association rule mining algorithms-Apriori to extract valuable insights from the dataset.
<br>

 ## Algorithms Used ðŸ’­

 **Apriori:** A classic algorithm that uses an iterative approach to generate frequent itemsets and association rules by pruning the search space based on the Apriori property.


## ðŸ‘‰ Application
Utilize the generated association rules to optimize product placement, cross-selling, and promotional strategies to enhance the shopping experience and increase sales.
